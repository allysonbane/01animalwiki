Although there was history of them in the 1600’s, in 1931<br> Mary Crane founded the breed in America. in 1931, her company Basquaerie Great Pyrenees imported the first Great Pyrenees from France. They imported nearly 60 <br> Great Pyrenees, representing more than 10 distinct bloodlines. Fossil remains of dogs similar to Great Pyrs have been found in Bronze Age deposits dating back <br> from 1800 to 1000 B.C. The eighteenth century, the Great Pyrenees was very appreciated and loved by the French nobility.
